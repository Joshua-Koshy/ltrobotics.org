I"<p>Our robotâ€™s name is Dick Cheney. Our bot is in the lower right corner. Our robot has come to its current state through multiple iterations of different pieces, each piece meticulously designed and documented with our engineering notebook.<br />
Some pieces, such as the arms, have been designed and redesigned multiple times in order to correct problems we found in previous designs. This is truly the iterative process in engineering at work, improving upon each previous design to improve our robot and our ability to perform.</p>
