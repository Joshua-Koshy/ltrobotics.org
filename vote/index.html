                            <h5>Who are you? (answer as you wish...)</h5>
                            <p><b>Robert Delmark: </b>My name is Robert Delmark and I am applying to be treasurer. I was a scout and a builder for B team, and I was a founding member of the Robotics club as the treasurer for the 2019-2020 school year.</p>

                            <h5>Why do you think you are qualified for this position?</h5>
                            <p><b>Robert Delmark: </b>I know I am qualified for this position because I have already done it. Last year I was the treasurer and i helped establish the structure of our officer system. I helped found this club and i want to help it grow. I am also excellent with finances and I know how to establish fundraisers, work with the school, and how to manage VEX network.</p>

                            <p><b>Robert Delmark: </b>I will bring creativity and conviction. This year was a rush so a quick easy set up fundraiser was needed but next school year I will have time to plan and create a better fundraiser, no more selling candy before Halloween I promise. I also bring an understanding of the position; not only was I treasurer last year, but I helped create our officer structure. I  understand what our treasure needs to do to be successful, and I believe that I can bring success.</p>

                            <p><b>Robert Delmark: </b>I have been extremely involved with robotics. I have spent hours after school multiple times a week and during CavTime to building our robot and to being treasurer. I helped create the robotics club. I was in the Robotics I class and i will soon be in the Robotics II class.</p>

                            <p><b>Joshua Koshy: </b>What I may lack in experience, I have in commitment. I make it early for most meetings to get more time to work on our bot. Last year when our bot was incomplete, I was one of the few people who stayed extra mornings and afternoons, skipping my normal activities to get our bot working. In addition, I can speak well in the absence of the President and Vice. As a former scout, I was able to get us parts and help from different teams whenever we needed it. Also, I was able to secure us, partners, when we did not make it to the top 10 or so. In my free time, I would also be able to work on the website and update it regularly. Overall I believe that this role is a good fit for me. </p>
