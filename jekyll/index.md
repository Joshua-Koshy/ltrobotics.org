Lake Travis High School Robotics started out in the 2018-2019 school year.\
\
Our program currently has one coach, Mr. Mills.\
\
Currently, the program consist of three teams:
RoboCAVS(78738A), CAValanche(78738B), and the ThunderCAVS(78738C).\
\
We are a young program but we hope to become a large team in the VEX Competition world.
